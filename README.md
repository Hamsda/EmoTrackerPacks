# OoTRMapTracker

## Content

This is a pack for [EmoTracker](https://emotracker.net/) designed for the [Ocarina of Time Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/).
You can easily download it from within the EmoTracker application.

This pack allows you to keep track of your current item loadout and has maps with all item locations for child and adult Link. These locations get filtered by your current item loadout to only show what you can actually reach.

## Questions

If you have any questions regarding the pack or the tracker itself, I recommend joining the [EmoTracker discord](https://emotracker.net/community/) and asking in there. Or you can just send me a DM on Discord to __Hamsda#4585__ or open an issue on Github.

## Variants

The pack offers 5 different variants:

1. Regular Map Tracker
2. Keysanity Map Tracker
3. Items Only
4. Items Only (Keysanity)
5. Items Only (minimal)

## Vanilla vs Master Quest Dungeons

The Randomizer has the option to switch some or all dungeons to their Master Quest equivalents.  
To accomodate for this, you can click on the dungeon labels to change them from vanilla ![vanilla deku](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/label_deku.png) to Master Quest ![mq deku](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/label_deku_mq.png). You can use this in the non map variants as well as a reminder.  
This also means that the key counts for the dungeons in the Keysanity variants will always go up to the maximum of vanilla and Master Quest: Forest Temple goes up to 6 small keys, because MQ Forest Temple has 6 small keys instead of 5 in vanilla; Water Temple also goes up to 6 small keys, because vanilla Water Temple has 6 small keys unlike the 2 it has in MQ.

## Special items

Some of this functionality might not be immediately obvious:

- Right clicking ![Fairy Ocarina](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/fairyocarina.png "Fairy Ocarina")/![Ocarina of Time](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/ocarina.png "Ocarina of Time") will overlay it with ![Scarecrow](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/scarecrow_badge.png "Scarecrow"), indicating that you have confirmed the scarecrow song or started with free scarecrow. Locations that make use of the scarecrow will show up as sequence breaks unless this is turned on.
- Checking ![Stone of Agony](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/agony.png "Stone of Agony") enables you to capture items placed at locations you received hints for by the Gossip Stones, even if you selected hints to be always on or require Mask of Truth instead of Stone of Agony.
- ![Ice Trap](ootrando_overworldmap_hamsda/images/icetrap.png "Ice Trap") is used as a counter for ice traps. This is somewhat useful to evaluate freestanding items during racing, but mostly just for fun with settings that include higher numbers of ice traps.

## Settings (for map variants)
