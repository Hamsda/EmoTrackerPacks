# Settings (for map variants)

There is a variety of toggles available to accomodate the different settings the randomizer offers. The settings are arranged to mimic the current GUI of the randomizer.

The presets icon is a customizable preset loader. Cycle through the presets with left click and load with right click (some settings might require an extra right click since they depend on other settings).
To customize the presets, please override `scripts/user_presets.lua` and edit to your liking. I hope the structure is fairly straightforward. Which setting number corresponds to which setting can be found in `items/options.json` (0 based indexing).

## Main Rules: Open

This tab contains most of the important settings that determine how "open" a randomizer seed is ([see wiki](https://wiki.ootrandomizer.com/index.php?title=Readme#Open)).

I have not found a good way to represent that a trial started as dispelled.

## Main Rules: World
